# Tonal Harmony Solar System 

Create a React web app visualizing tonal harmony as a solar system. The solar system should be in the middle of the screen where the sun naturally holds the center position.

## Structure:
- Sun (center): C (tonic)
- Planets (orbiting sun): d, e, F, G, a, b° (diatonic chords in C major)
- Moons (orbiting planets): A7 around d, B7 around e, C7 around F, D7 around G, E7 around a

## Visual requirements:
- Canvas fills entire viewport with dark space background
- Twinkling stars scattered across background
- Planets have 3D gradient effect (distinct colors for each)
- All orbits start at random positions with varied speeds
- Movement of planets and moons should not be to fast
- Orbital paths shown as subtle rings
- Title "Tonal Harmony Solar System" in Cascadia Mono font at top

## Technical:
- Use Canvas API for rendering
- Smooth animations
- Responsive/fullscreen design
