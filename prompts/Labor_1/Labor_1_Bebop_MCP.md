# Section 1: Jazz - a History of Innovation
Jazz has always been a music of innovation and change. From its origins in New Orleans at the turn
of the 20th century through ragtime, swing, and the big band era, jazz constantly evolved through
the creative vision of individual musicians. By the late 1930s, swing music dominated American
popular culture - large orchestras played danceable arrangements for ballroom audiences across the
nation. Yet within this commercial success, a younger generation of musicians felt constrained by
the heavily arranged format of big bands. They sought greater harmonic complexity, faster tempos,
and more freedom for improvisation. During informal after-hours jam sessions at clubs like Minton’s
Playhouse in Harlem, these innovators experimented with unconventional chromaticism, complex
chord substitutions, and asymmetrical phrasing. What emerged was bebop - a revolutionary style
that transformed jazz from dance music into an art form demanding close listening. The shift
occurred during World War II, when many large swing bands disbanded and musicians formed
smaller combos that allowed individual expression to flourish.

# Section 2: Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie
**Charlie Parker (1920-1955)** - Alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, nicknamed ”Bird,” was born in
Kansas City and became bebop’s most influential voice. After studying the flowing lines of tenor
saxophonist Lester Young with the Count Basie Orchestra, Parker experienced a breakthrough mo-
ment in 1942 while playing ”Cherokee” at Monroe’s Uptown House. He discovered that using the
upper intervals of chords as melodic lines, backed by related harmonic changes, allowed him to play
the sophisticated ideas he heard in his mind. Parker’s technical virtuosity, harmonic innovation,
and melodic genius established the vocabulary of modern jazz. His compositions like ”Ornithol-
ogy,” ”Anthropology,” and ”Confirmation” became standards, and his improvisations on blues and
rhythm changes demonstrated unprecedented creativity. Despite struggles with addiction, Parker
recorded prolifically from 1944 until his death in 1955, leaving a legacy that influenced generations
of musicians.
**Dizzy Gillespie (1917-1993)** - Trumpeter John Birks ”Dizzy” Gillespie was bebop’s other
founding father and its most visible ambassador. Initially influenced by Roy Eldridge, Gillespie
developed his harmonic concepts while playing with Cab Calloway’s orchestra in the early 1940s.
At Minton’s Playhouse, he collaborated with Parker to forge bebop’s revolutionary language. Gille-
spie’s contributions extended beyond performance - he was an exceptional composer (”A Night in
Tunisia,” ”Salt Peanuts,” ”Groovin’ High”) and a pioneer of Afro-Cuban jazz through collabora-
tions with percussionist Chano Pozo. His extroverted personality, humor, trademark bent trumpet,
beret, and goatee made him bebop’s public face. Gillespie led innovative big bands in the late 1940s
and continued performing and teaching until his death in 1993, spreading bebop’s message world-
wide.
